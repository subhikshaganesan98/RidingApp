My application Andriod ridding application where users can log rides, track progress, and participate in a points-based transaction system. Users can choose to be either a rider or a driver, with tailored features for each role. Riders can log trips, track details like distance and duration, and spend earned points on various in-app rewards or services. Drivers earn points based on completed rides, which can also be used for transactions within the platform. The app features a secure login system powered by Google Firebase, allowing users to register and log in using their email and password. Additionally, users can access a personal history to review past rides, manage their point balances, and ensure all activities are securely stored and retrieved via Firebase.
