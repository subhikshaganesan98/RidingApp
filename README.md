My application is a riding app where users can log rides, track progress, and participate in a points-based transaction system. Users can choose to be either a rider or a driver, with tailored features for each role. Riders can log trips, track details like distance and duration, and spend earned points on various in-app rewards or services. Drivers earn points based on completed rides, which can also be used for transactions within the platform. The app includes a personal history feature for users to review past rides and track their point balances. If required fields are not completed, an error prompts users to provide the missing information. Firebase ensures secure data storage and seamless retrieval for all user activities.
